# elasticms-demo
A default elasticms local setup using docker-compose

## Prerequisites

You need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or docker-compose (or an alternative as Podman).

It's recommended to [allow at least 6GB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43460770/docker-windows-container-memory-limit) of memory to Docker

The following ports must be available:
 - 8888: Traefik UI
 - 80: Web HTTP
 - 443: Web HTTPS

## Install steps

Create a `dist` folder.

Depending your OS you might need to give the execute rights to the project's scripts: `chmod u+x *.sh`

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
- `npm install`: install NPM dependencies
  - or `./npm.sh install`
- `npm run prod`: Build the frontend assets (js, css, ...)
  - or `./npm.sh run prod`
- `docker-compose up -d`: Start the docker container (in daemon mode)

Before continuing, check that all services have been correctly started by running `docker-compose ps`. All services must be in `Up` state or in `Up (healthy)` state. 

Go to [minio](http://minio.localhost/login) and login with those credentials:
- user: accesskey
- password: secretkey
  And create a `demo` bucket.

Go back to your console:
- `./create-users.sh` (or `create-users.cmd` under Windows)
  - A `demo` admin user is created with the email and the password that you provide
  - You have now access to an empty [elasticms](http://demo-admin.localhost/dashboard) 
- `./bootstrap.sh` (or `bootstrap.cmd` under Windows) will setup elasticms's configuration, content types, documents & so forth.
  - The script will ask for the `demo` admin user you just defined

It's all set: [elasticms](http://demo-admin.localhost/dashboard)

Check the [preview](http://demo-preview.localhost) and the [live](http://demo-live.localhost)

You can now login with your just defined password (with the`./create-users.sh` script) and the username `demo` in [elasticms](http://demo-admin.localhost/dashboard).

## Jobs

## User

Some default user are created by the `./create-users.sh` script:
- author: can edit web documents
- publisher: can edit and publish web documents in live
- webmaster: can edit and publish all kind of documents


## Commands

Every script bellow exist as `.cmd` and as `.sh` file.

- `bootstrap`: Create (or update) elasticms from the local config files (push everything)
- `create-admin`: Create a `demo` user with ADMIN and API rights 
- `demo-admin`: Run the elasticms's Symfony console 
- `demo-preview`: Run the skeleton's Symfony console in preview context
- `demo-live`: Run the skeleton's Symfony console in live context
- `doc`: Shortcut to docker-compose
- `npm`: Run a npm console (in a docker run container)
- `update-local-configs`: Update the local config files from elasticms (pull everything)

## Troubleshooting

### FAQ

- The labels are not translated in the skeleton: clear the cache for the corresponding skeleton i.e. `demo-preview cache:clear`
- I do not see form submissions in the elasticms mini-CRM: Please update the auth-key in the form config 
- Updates in the webpack/npm application (`/src`) are not taken into account with the `npm run watch` command: In some cases docker-compose doesn't allow npm to be notified on file changes. You should, or use the `npm run dev` command eachtime that you need. Or use a local installation of npm.
